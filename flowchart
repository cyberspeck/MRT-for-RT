load MRI / CT dicom files as 'Volume'

calculate:
 -Centroids
 -coordShift
 -coordDist
 -Dice

----------------------------------
Volume:

read files as SimplITK image
denoise (optional)
check for inregularities (needs ref slice)
	gets average brightness of ref slice
	loops through all slices:
		current slice average brightness deviates too much from ref slice: irregular slice

if no seeds given: save location of brightest pixel in each regular slice as seed

----------------------------------
getCentroid:

executes getThresholds
 based on imaging modality, known diameter of rod, and pixel spacing,
 the script calculates how pixelNumber that is needed to form a circular area corresponding to the (undistorted) cross section area visible on one slice
 max value of ref slice is saved as upper threshold
 value of brightest pixel after ignoring the brightest pixelNumber pixels is saved as lower threshold

executes sitk_centroid
 loops through all slices:
	if current slice has no pixel above lower threshold: set centroid to (-1,-1) ERROR
	else: use all pixels above lower threshold to calculate their centre of mass (= centroid)

----------------------------------
sitk_coordShift:

calculate x and y shift between to lists of centroids

----------------------------------
sitk_coordDist:

calculates norm for each entry of array
returns array with list of calculated values

----------------------------------
getDice:

execute getMask:
 create new SimpleITK image with equal dimension as loaded image, but pixels have either value 0 or 1
 value 1 is assigned to all pixels above lower threshold, 0 elsewhere.
 additional constraint: area has to be connected to seed

execute sitk_dice_circle
 Dice coefficient, inspired by
 Medpy (http://pythonhosted.org/MedPy/_modules/medpy/metric/binary.html)

 Computes the Dice coefficient (akas Sorensen index) between a binary
 object in an image and a circle.

 The metric is defined as:
  DC=\frac{2|A\cap B|}{|A|+|B|}
 where A is the first and B the second set of samples (here: binary objects)
 The Dice coefficient between the object(s) in ```input``` and the
  created circles. It ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap).
  if centroid coordinates + radius would create circle exceeding image
  size: DC of this slice = -1
  Other errors occuring during the calculation should also result in -1

or execute sitk_dice_circle with iterations
