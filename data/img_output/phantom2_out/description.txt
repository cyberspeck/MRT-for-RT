Exported ".dcm" and ".mha" volume files are all masked CT images of a single rod.
In each slice all rod pixels have the same value (see below).
Where no value could be calculated (e.g. plastic panes in CT scan; air bubble in MRI) the rod pixels have the value of -1.

DC value (0 to 1) * 1000:
    CT_x1_DC-MR-opti.mha
    CT_x1_DC-MR-opti_CT-COM
distortion value (mm) *1000:
    CT_x1_warpMagnitude.mha
value * 10000:
    CT_x1_DC-warpDC_opti.mha
