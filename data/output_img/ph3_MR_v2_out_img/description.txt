Exported ".mha" volume files are all masked CT images of a single rod for warpMagnitude and MR images of the same Rod for MR DC.
In each slice all rod pixels have the same value (see below).
Where no value could be calculated (e.g. plastic panes in CT scan; air bubble in MRI) the rod pixels have the value of -1.

DC value (0 to 1) * 1000:
    MR_x100_DC_MR_CT-COM_iter.mha
    MR_x100_DC_MR_CT-COM_simple.mha
    MR_x100_DC_MR_iter.mha
    MR_x100_DC_MR_simple.mha
distortion value (mm) *1000:
    CT_x100_warpMagnitude_iter.mha
    CT_x100_warpMagnitude_simple.mha
